@ Design Project 1: Arrays & Procedures
@ Description: This program computes the rounded average of a 16-element temperature
@			   array and store this rounded average in memory. In addition, this program
@			   uses a procedure to determine the maximum and minimum temperature values
@			   of the day (from the 16-element array), the values are stored in memory.
@ Registers Used: R0 - R8
